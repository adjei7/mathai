AI-Driven Math App Demo, where AI controls the feedback, levels and motivation features

This app uses AI to dynamically adjust the (1) feedback, (2) difficulty level, (3) the threshold time for rewards and (4) the triggering of a timed challenge to maintain motivation, all based on per question student performance! Please note the main purpose of this app is for testing AI adapting motivation techniques and not as a live student assement platform.
